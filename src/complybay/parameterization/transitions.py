"""Smooth-step shapes for gradational interfaces in 1-D velocity models.

Copied from SeisForge (seisforge.inv.transitions, commit 019d568).

An interface at depth ``z_i`` with 10-90 % width ``w`` blends the segment
above into the segment below with a weight ``S(z)`` that rises from 0 to 1:

    v(z) = (1 - S(z)) * v_upper(z) + S(z) * v_lower(z)

``S(z_i) = 0.5``, ``S`` reaches 10 % and 90 % at ``z_i -/+ w/2``, and ``S`` is
exactly 0 above and exactly 1 below a finite support ``z_i -/+ h``. Compact
support keeps one interface from leaking into the free surface, a thin layer,
or a neighbouring interface. ``w = 0`` is a hard step.

Shapes
------
``sigmoid``
    Logistic ``1 / (1 + exp(-k (z - z_i)))`` with steepness ``k = 2 ln 9 / w``,
    truncated at ``h = 2 w`` (where the logistic tail is 1.5e-4) and rescaled to
    reach exactly 0 and 1. Maximum gradient ``~ 1.1 dv / w``.
``smootherstep``
    Quintic ``6x^5 - 15x^4 + 10x^3`` on the support; C2-continuous with
    ``h = 0.987 w``. Maximum gradient ``~ 0.93 dv / w``.
